<p>To Keep error handling and messaging DRY and centralized, we created a ErrorCodes module that is included in the User Object
This way, all error messages and numeric error codes are in one place and MUCH easier to maintain</p>

<p>It is a conscious deviation from using ActiveModel which puts all error messages in each class
  and it&rsquo;s difficult to maintain unique numeric error codes across classes</p>

<p>Developer Note: **It is the intention to make this integrate more with ActiveModel in the future, but for now this works just fine</p>

<p>module ErrorCode
  has one GLOBAL<em>ERRORS constant
  the rest correlate directly with User Actions, one Hash for each User Action
  See app/models/user.rb #### USER ACTIONS section for the User Actions Code
  See app/models/model</em>validations.rb for each validation of User Actions that raise exceptions with these ErrorCode symbols</p>
